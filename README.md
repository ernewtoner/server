## Local Database Setup for UNIX-based Systems
<!-- remove next two steps later because we'll want to seed the database as part of running the server locally in 'development' mode -->

1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) **major version 11** 
1. Switch to the postgres UNIX account: `sudo -i -u postgres`
1. Create a username and password (replace `username` with desired username): `createuser username --pwprompt`
1. Enter password to be used for the user you just created
1. Create a database (replace `database` with desired database name): `createdb database`
1. Exit the postgres UNIX account: `exit`
1. Access the postgres prompt of the user and database you created (replace `database` and `username` with that which you just created): `psql -h localhost -d database -U username`
1. Import table initialization queries at the root of the project: `\i /pathtoproject/init_tables.sql`
1. Import test data queries at the root of the project: `\i /pathtoproject/init_test_data.sql`
1. Exit postgres prompt: `\q`
1. Create a file named `.env` at the root of the project and with the following information (replace `username` with your username and `password` with the username password):
```sh
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=username
DB_PASS=password
```

## Locally Run Server

OS X, Linux and Windows:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

<!-- ## Usage example -->

<!-- A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._ -->

<!-- ## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
``` -->
